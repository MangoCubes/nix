** Rules
- `secrets` folders contain secrets that are necessary at the build time (i.e. secrets that cannot be secured with AGS) as well as secrets that are encrypted with sops-nix
** What does this repo not have?
- All `hardware-configuration.nix`: Why are you using mine?
- All secrets: These are imported by a submodule in a different repo. Search by the string `inputs.secrets` if you want to use my config.
- ags widget code: These are in another repository.
- /res, where wallpapers and public key are stored
- Entire server-media config
